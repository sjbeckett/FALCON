FALCON
======

FALCON is a package designed to enable the analysis of nestedness and help compare different nestedness measures and associated null models in bipartite networks.


![FALCONs falcon](https://raw.github.com/sjbeckett/FALCON/master/Documentation/RAWfiles/falcon.png)

It is currently implemented for use in [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/matlab/), [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and [R](http://www.r-project.org/). A Python wrapper for the MATLAB version of FALCON, with thanks to Orazio Angelini, [is also available](https://github.com/ganileni/py_falcon).

## Features

FALCON allows computation of six nestedness measures for binary networks:
* [NODF](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16644.x)
* [Manhattan Distance](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2012.05.003)
* [spectral radius](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms2422)
* [nested temperature calculator](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317508)
* [discrepancy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050784)
* the [Johnson et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0074025) nestedness measure

and significance testing under five binary null models:
SS, FF, CC, DD and EE

Additionally spectral radius and WNODF measures can be used for the analysis of weighted networks under four weighted null models.
